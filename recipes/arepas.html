    <h1>Arepas</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups pre-cooked white corn meal ( such as P.A.N Â®)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir water and salt together in a bowl. Gradually stir corn meal into water with your fingers until mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 golf ball-size balls and pat each one into a patty about 3/8-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, cook corn patties in hot oil until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Slice halfway through each cake horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>nutrition:</h3>
    <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.
